## Abstract

Proof of Credit (PoC) is a consensus mechanism for Blockchain that can be used as an alternative to Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. The main advantage of PoC over PoS and  PoW is that it doesn't require the same upfront investment as it does in proof of stake (although it requires some amount of token for you to stake ) while conserving energy usage. Although PoS makes the Blockchain more viable from a resource point of view but, that also makes it more centralized in terms that the people with the most resources are the most probable to participate in the Block creation process .
